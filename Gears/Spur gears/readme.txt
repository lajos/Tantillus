I wanted quieter gears, so made these spur gears out of MDF on a CNC machine.
Each gear is made up of two pieces, slightly offset so they act similar to the herring bone gears.

The sets have two of the gears flipped. This is useful if cutting on CNC machine where the stock first has to be planed to the desired width.

To make:
  - cut 4 pieces of upper and 4 pieces of lower gear halves
  - the absolute maximum width of the stock is 4mm with the official Tantillus rod lengths
  - print 2 upper and 2 lower clamps

Hardware:
  - 8 pcs #8-32 x 3/8" set screws
  - 8 pcs #8-32 square nuts, or regular hex nuts with one side filed off
  - 8 pcs #4-40 x 1/2" screws
  - 8 pcs #4-40 nuts

Assembly:
  - optional: size the mdf with 1:4 yellow wood glue:water mix
  - align gear halves using the #4 holes
    - gear teeth should be offset from each other (where there's a tooth on one gear, there should be a hole on the other)
  - assemble two halves and the clamp with #4 screws
