Case diles modified to work with US 1/4" stock (around 6.5mm).

one_piece: these are the hole panels

joint: my CNC could not fit the whole panels, so I added a joint and made each panel from two pieces. Use two maters on each side to hold the panels while the glue sets.

aligner: I glued my case, used two of these (one on top, one bottom) to make sure the frame square (car tie downs to clamp while drying).
