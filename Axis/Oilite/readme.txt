These parts use Oilite lubricated bronze sleeve bearings instead of the lm8uus and printed bushings.

Benefits:
  - no maintanence (the bearings are magically self lubricating)
  - zero noise
  - no play
  - all rods are the same size, 5/16"
  - oilites are easy to find (probably even your hardware store has them) 

Cons:
  - none so far

All rods are 5/16". No 8mm rods used.

Bearings 5/26" ID x 1/2" OD:
  - x/y ends: 1", 4 pcs (mcmaster 6391K443)
  - carriage: 1" or 1.25", 4 pcs (mcmaster 6391K443 or 6391K444)
  - cable z: 0.5", 4 pcs (mcmaster 6391K405) 


Notes:

  - The bearings fit snugly in the printed parts. If the holes are too tight, drill them out with 1/2" drill bit.

  - Don't drill into the bearings for the XY ends. Make sure the #8 screw doesn't touch the bearings. Either use a smaller one or cut it shorter.

  - Two 1/2" bearings go into each z-arm. Each oilite is sandwiched between two spacers, that are glued in place. Don't glue the oilites.

  - I currently have 1" oilites in the carriage.

The oilites need a short break in period so they get their juices going. When first assembled the carriage should slide free and without binding, but after an hour or two of printing things will get even silkier smoother.


Future:
  - try 7/16" or 3/8" OD oilites (cheaper, less weight)
  - improve z arm mounting (no need for zip tie holes, create pockets for oilites)
  - reduce carriage size (bearings are shorter than carraige)
